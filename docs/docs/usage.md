# batch evals

Make batch eval using the API

## step 1 : edit the qa_sample.json in the project root

```json
[
  {
    "model": "gemini-2.5-flash",
    "prompt": "What is the capital of {{country}}?",
    "expected": "{{capital}}",
    "judge_model": "gemini-2.5-pro",
    "criteria": "The model must name the correct capital city of the country.",
    "tags": ["geography", "capital-cities"],
    "metadata": { "country": "France", "capital": "Paris" }
  },
  {
    "model": "gemini-2.5-flash",
    "prompt": "What is the capital of {{country}}?",
    "expected": "{{capital}}",
    "judge_model": "gemini-2.5-pro",
    "criteria": "The model must name the correct capital city of the country.",
    "tags": ["geography", "capital-cities"],
    "metadata": { "country": "Germany", "capital": "Berlin" }
  }
```

## step 2 : call the API endpoint (cURL example)
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/evals/batch \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '@qa_sample.json' | jq
```
